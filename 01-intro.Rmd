As traffic on freeways continues to rise, developing a reliable method to regulate the flow of vehicles onto the freeway has become increasingly important. A primary method that was first implemented in the 1960s is the ramp meter. A ramp meter is a traffic signal that is placed on the freeway on-ramp, designed to control the rate at which vehicles enter the freeway and therefore prevent it from exceeding capacity. Although ramp meters may improve freeway traffic conditions, they often generate a queue, causing vehicles to wait on the ramp prior to entering the freeway. 

Research has previously been done to estimate the queue length at on-ramps to freeways, but most conclude that while certain methods improve queue size estimation, each possess flaws would prevent it from being widely implemented across many ramps without significant calibration. This paper aims to improve these previously developed methods, thus providing algorithms that more accurately report the expected queue length and wait time on any given on-ramp that utilizes ramp metering. 

This project will focus on estimating the queue length on three on-ramps throughout Davis, Salt Lake, and Utah Counties. The ramps chosen for analysis are the northbound on-ramp to I-15 at Layton Parkway in Davis County, the southbound on-ramp at Bangerter Highway in Salt Lake County, and the southbound on-ramp at University Avenue in Utah County. 

Two methods to estimate queue length are discussed in this paper, including a conservation model and a Kalman filter model. The Kalman filter model includes several variations to find a method that most accurately reflects field-observed queue lengths. Various components of the ramp such as the number of lanes, the ramp length, its traffic volume and occupancy, the metering rate, and the time of day will be considered. By understanding the impact of these characteristics on ramp operation and using data gathered on the ramp, the expected queue length and wait time for vehicles can be computed.
